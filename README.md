## Contact Management System in C++

### Introduction
This **Contact Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C++**, demonstrating the use of **file handling** and **basic object-oriented programming** concepts. It provides an efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage contact information, making it a practical tool for understanding how data can be persistently stored and accessed in C++.

The project is designed to manage contacts by allowing users to perform operations such as:
- Adding a new contact.
- Viewing all saved contacts.
- Searching for specific contacts.
- Deleting or updating existing contacts.

File handling is a key component of this project, ensuring that all contact data is securely stored in text files, making the information persistent even after the program is closed.

### Features
- **Add Contact**: Save details like name, phone number, and email.
- **View Contacts**: Display all stored contact information in an organized format.
- **Search Contacts**: Quickly locate a contact by name or other details.
- **Edit and Delete**: Update or remove existing contacts from the file.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses file handling to store contact information locally.

### Purpose
This project is ideal for:
- Learning and understanding file handling in C++.
- Developing problem-solving skills by implementing real-world applications.
- Practicing the basics of data structures and object-oriented programming.

### Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code or any C++ IDE
- **File Handling**: Text files for data persistence
